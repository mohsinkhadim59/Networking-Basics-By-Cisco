## 📌 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repo to your local machine.  
2. Open the `labs/` folder – each lab contains a `.pkt` file (Packet Tracer project) and a README with step‑by‑step instructions.  
3. Run the labs sequentially; the order follows the course outline above.  
4. Keep the `solutions/` folder closed – try to solve each lab on your own first.  
5. Once you’re done, submit the lab reports or answers in the `answers/` folder for review.
