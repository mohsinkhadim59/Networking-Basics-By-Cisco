- There are multiple ways to it
	-  **Method 1**
	- Click on the **PC** ⇒ Config Tab ⇒ FastEhernet0. Here you can see that **Static Address** is assigned to it where the `IPv4 Address` is `192.168.1.3` and subnet mask is `255.255.255.0` where the first three octets (`25.255.255`) represent the network and the fourth octet `0` tells us about the **Host Machine/PC**

>[!tip]
>If you go to the settings or fasteth0 in the config tab and you see the DHCP is checked and not the static address, you will still be able to see the IP Address, Gateway and subnet mask but it will be grayed out meaning the host is requesting ip address from the server itself.
