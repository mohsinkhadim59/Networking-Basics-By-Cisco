>[!Important] **Tasks and Objectives**
>Objectives and Tasks of this activity are :
>- [x] Investigate Devices in a Wiring Closet ✅ 2025-11-16
>- [x] Connect End Devices to Networking Devices ✅ 2025-11-16
>- [x] Install a Backup Router ✅ 2025-11-16
>- [x] Configure a Hostname ✅ 2025-11-16

>[!Notes]
>- You can inspect the devices in the **Physical Mode** and then zoom in and **Right-Click** the device you want to explore, menu will appear where you can click the **Inspect Front or Inspect Rear** to closely see the ports and consoles of the devices and it can also ease in connecting the devices with the cables to your desired ports.

> - There are two way to look at a network in Packet Tracer. 
> 	- **Logical** mode shows you how devices are connected in the network. 
> 	- **Physical** mode shows you where the devices are located in the network. This activity opens in and focuses on **Physical** mode. 
> 	- You can switch between these modes at any time to compare the differences by clicking the **Logical** (Shift-L) and **Physical** (Shift-P) buttons.
> - PCs and laptops can also be connected to networking devices using a console cable or a USB cable. This connection provides management access. **Management access is used to view and change device configurations.**
> -  The CLI is accessible via the device console port using terminal software or remotely via Secure Shell (SSH). Network administrators use a computer to access the device console in order to create or modify the device configuation.

- Configuration of the hostname of router by going to the laptop connected to the router via console cable or USB cable then going to its Desktop Tab--> Terminal and entering the following commands in order.
	- First, you need say **no** when asked for initial configuration and then press **Enter** to type in the commands as below:
```bash
Router> enable
Router# **configure terminal**
Router(config)# **hostname Edge_Router_Backup**
Edge_Router_Backup(config)# **end**
```
