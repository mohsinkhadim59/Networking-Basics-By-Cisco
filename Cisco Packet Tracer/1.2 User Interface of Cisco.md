- Examples can be opened by going to **Menu**--> **Open Samples** or by just pressing **Ctrl+Shift+T**
- Options-->Preferences to Customize User Experience. In the **Miscellaneous** tab of Preferences you can set Auto-back up interval which is off by Default
- Blue bar at the top is called workspace toolbar having two buttons.
	- **Logical** - you can see how devices are connected and how data will flow through the network.
	- **Physical** - you can see how devices are laid out and connected like equipment rack or PCs that we have connected as well as the cabling.
- There are two buttons at the bottom (left) as well
	- **Power cycle button** is to power all the devices
	- **Fast Forward button** is to quickly converge the network and not wait for all the protocols to finish their processes.
- Similarly, there are two buttons at the bottom (right) as well
	- **Real time** is basically the real time in the network as things are happening
	- **Simulation mode** allows us to control the time as well as add packets and watch them travel across the network
- On bottom end to the left one will be able to see **network components** such as routers, switches, PCs and other devices to be added to the topology and of course the cable to connect those devices.
- And lastly there is status bar on the bottom right to check the status of different packets travelling across the network.
