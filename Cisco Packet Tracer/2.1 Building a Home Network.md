	- Click on the **PC** ⇒ Config Tab ⇒ FastEhernet0. Here you can see that **Static Address** is assigned to it where the `IPv4 Address` is `192.168.1.3` and subnet mask is `255.255.255.0` where the first three octets (`25.255.255`) represent the network and the fourth octet `0` tells us about the **Host Machine/PC**
