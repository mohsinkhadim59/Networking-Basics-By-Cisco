Packet Tracer has the ability to create four different types of files. These file types are used for different purposes and include where our primary focus will be on the **.pkt** file types only: 
- .pka 
	- The .pka file type is a Packet Tracer Activity file and is the file type you will experience most often. Think of the “a” in .pka as meaning “activity.”
- .**pkt**
	- **The .pkt file type is created when a simulated network is built in Packet Tracer and saved. The .pkt file can also have graphic background images embedded within it. However, .pkt files have no instructions window or activity scoring**
- .pksz
	- The .pksz file type is specific to Packet Tracer Tutored Activities (PTTA).hese files bundle a .pka file, media assets, and a scripting file for the hinting system.
- .pkz
	- This file type was previously used to embed images and other files in a Packet Tracer file. However, images are now embedded directly within a regular .pkt or .pka file by default. Therefore, consider .pkz as a deprecated file type.
