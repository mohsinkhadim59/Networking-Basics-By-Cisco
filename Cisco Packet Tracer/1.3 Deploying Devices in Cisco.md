- On the bottom left are the cisco `network devices` such as servers, routers , PCs and switches etc.
	- Top row are the categories and bottom row are the sub categories.
>[!Example]
> 1. Click wireless devices and then **WRT300N** home router to drag the router in the space.
> 2. Go to end devices and select PC and a laptop.
> 	1. Under end devices category go to sub category and select home. Then navigate to find the webcam and add it to the topology as well.
> 3. To connect these devices go to connections category (`the flash symbol in the bottom left`)
> 	1. Picking up the **orange red lightning bolt** to automatically select the type of cable.
> 		a. If we select the cable and then connect the **router and PC**, it will automatically choose the cable type and will connect both of them to the first available port. Same can be done to connect the **router** to the **webcam**. We will use different way to connect the laptop to the router. Because laptop doesn't contain wireless card.

> 4. Now click the laptop and first turn it off by the **power button** you see in the **physical device view**.
> 	1. Power off the laptop and drag the **FASTETH0** card to the left side in the modules.

> 1. Now we can add wireless card in that place by dragging the **WPC300N** from the left side in the module section to the empty slot which is a wireless interface and then power on the laptop again. As soon as you turn the laptop again it will automatically be connected to the wireless router via wireless connection.
