🔗  [Foundations of Cybersecurity](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-of-cybersecurity/home/week/1) 
## Past Attacks

- **Two NoteAble attacks**
	 - **Love Letter Malware**: Emails ⇒ Attachments  ⇒ Scan ⇒ Addressbook Access for the Contacts ⇒ Send link to all ⇒  Install Program ⇒ Capture Credentials 
		 - Data breach of users is because of preference of  **Convenience over privacy** 
	 >[!Notes] **Phishing**
		>   - Phishing is the use of digital communications to trick people into revealing sensitive data or deploying malicious software.
		>    - **Social engineering** is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables.
	 - **EquiFax** attack data breach via Phishing stealing customer records including PII and SPII.
	   -  575 Million Dollar in Damages 
 >[!Warning]  
   >Never Prefer Convenience over Privacy
   
   ## Attacks in Digital Age
-  **Certified Information Systems Security Professional** 
	  - **Eight Security Domains**
	
		![CISSP](/Images/LPC.png)

	1.**Security And Risk Management**
	  - Define Security Goals, Objectives, Risk Mitigation, Compliance, Business Community and the Law

	2.**Asset** **Security**
	- Secures **digital** and **physical assets** as well as related to tasks of the storage and maintenance, retention, and destruction of data

	3.**Security Architecture and Engineering**
	- Optimizing the data security by ensuring effective tools , systems and processes are in place.

	4.**Communication and Network Security**
	  - Manage and physical networks and wireless communications.
		  - Example:  Unsecured WiFi

	5.**Identity and Access Management**
	- Keeps data secure by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets like office spaces, and logical assets such as networks and applications.
	  >[!Example]
	  >Correct Level of Access like tasking with the project of keycard access to the floor.
	  >

	6.**Security** **Operations**
	  -  Focuses on conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures.
	  >[!Example]
	  > Unknown device connected to your internal network. Then one has to follow policies and procedures to quickly stop the potential threat.
	  
	7.**Software Development Security**
	- Focuses on using secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services.
	  >[!Example]
	    > One of your partner teams is creating a new mobile app, then you may be asked to advise on the password policies or ensure that any user data is properly secured and managed

	8.**Security Assessment and Testing**
	- This domain focuses on conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.
	- Security analysts may conduct regular audits of user permissions, to make sure that users have the correct level of access.
