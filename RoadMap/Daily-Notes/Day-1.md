## Cybersecurity Definitions

- **Cybersecurity, or security**
	 - It is the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized access or criminal exploitation

>[!Example]
> Requiring complex passwords to access sites and services improves confidentiality by making it much more difficult for a threat actor to compromise them
   
-  **Threat Actor** 
	  - It is any person or group who presents a security risk

- **Security Analyst / Security Specialist**
  - Protects information systems by monitoring, identifying, and responding to security risks.
	  - Takes part in penetration testing and ethical hacking
	  - Installing prevention software
	  - Conducting periodic security audits

- **Cybersecurity Analyst / Cybersecurity Specialist**
	- Analyzes threats and implements defenses to secure data, networks, and applications.

- **Security Engineer**
	- Working with other teams to build new detections and improve the previous ones
	- Responding to detections and responding especially internal  ones

- **Playbook**
	- is a list of how to go through a certain detection, and what the analyst needs to look at in order to investigate those incidents.

- **SOC Analyst (Security Operations Center Analyst)**
  - Monitors security alerts in real time to detect, investigate, and respond to active cyber threats.

- **Information Security Analyst**
  - Enforces security policies and controls to maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information.

## Benefits of Security 
 -  Protection against internal and external threats
 -  Regulatory Compliance to avoid fines especially during audits
 -  Maintains and improve business productivity
 -  Reduce expenses like data losses and downtime
 -  Brand Trust

## Assignment
-  `Phishing emails` often contain multiple 
	- **red flags**—unusual signs that make them seem suspicious. Some red flags are subtle (like a generic greeting)
	- **definitive technical indicators** that prove the email is malicious (like a bad domain name)


> [!tip] 
> - ✅ **Secure:** Look for **HTTPS**, correct **spelling of domain**, and **no weird extra words** before the main brand name.
>- 🚩 **Suspicious:**>
> 	  - Uses **HTTP** (not secure)
> 	   - Domain is **not** the official one — anything **before the first slash** is the real domain
> 	   - Has strange prefixes like `login-security.net/...socialmedia...`
> 	   - The domain name of the company always remains first rather than becoming sub-domain

## Types of skills
- **Transferable Skills**
	- Skills that can be applied across different careers
		- Like Communication, Collaborate , Analysis, Problem Solving
- **Technical Skills** 
	- Skills that include requiring of knowledge to specific tools, policies and procedures. Following are few technical skills of an analyst :
		- Understanding programming languages i.e Python and SQL
		- SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) Tools
		- Computer Forensics
		- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs)
## PII Vs SPII
- **Sensitive personally identifiable information (SPII)**
	- A specific type of PII that falls under stricter handling guidelines
- **Personally identifiable information (PII)**
	- Any information used to infer an individual’s identity
