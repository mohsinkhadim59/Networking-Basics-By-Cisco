# Networking Basics Course – Overview & Learning Outcomes  

---

## Course Purpose  

The **Networking Basics** course introduces the core concepts and practical skills required to design, deploy, and maintain a small‑office or home‑office (SOHO) network. Students explore how devices communicate, the types of network media, and how to troubleshoot connectivity problems.  

---

## Key Topics Covered  

| Area | What You’ll Learn |
|------|-------------------|
| **Fundamentals of Network Communication** | How data travels, basic networking terminology, and the role of standards and protocols. |
| **Network Types & Components** | LANs, WANs, routers, switches, hubs, firewalls, and wireless access points. |
| **Wireless Configuration** | Setting up mobile devices, securing Wi‑Fi, and configuring integrated wireless routers. |
| **Network Media & Ethernet** | Physical cabling, signal propagation, and Ethernet frame structure. |
| **IP Addressing** | IPv4 addressing, subnetting, CIDR, IPv6 basics, and how IPs enable segmentation. |
| **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)** | Configuring DHCP servers to automatically assign IP addresses. |
| **Routing Basics** | How routers connect disparate networks and forward packets. |
| **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)** | Mapping IP addresses to MAC addresses for local delivery. |
| **LAN Design** | Building a fully‑connected local area network. |
| **Internet Access** | How clients reach internet services, DNS resolution, and common application‑layer protocols. |
| **Troubleshooting Tools** | Using ping, traceroute, ARP tables, and network analyzers to diagnose issues. |
