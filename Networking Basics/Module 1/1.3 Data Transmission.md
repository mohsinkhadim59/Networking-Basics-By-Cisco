## What Is Data?
Data is the raw information you generate whenever you **send**, **share**, or **upload** something on a device or network.

## Types of Data

### 1. **Volunteered Data**
Information you knowingly provide.
- You are aware it’s being collected.
- Examples: filling out forms, uploading photos, creating accounts.

### 2. **Inferred Data**
Information gathered from your activities without you directly providing it.
- Generated through patterns of behavior.
- Example: credit/ATM card usage reveals:
  - Shopping preferences  
  - Places you visit  
  - Travel patterns (e.g., transaction in Portland while living in Florida)
