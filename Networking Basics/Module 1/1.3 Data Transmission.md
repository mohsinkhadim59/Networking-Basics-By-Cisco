## What Is Data?
Data is the raw information you generate whenever you **send**, **share**, or **upload** something on a device or network.

## Types of Data

### 1. **Volunteered Data**
Information you knowingly provide.
- You are aware it’s being collected.
- Examples: filling out forms, uploading photos, creating accounts.

### 2. **Inferred Data**
Information gathered from your activities without you directly providing it.
- Generated through patterns of behavior.
- Example: credit/ATM card usage reveals:
  - Shopping preferences  
  - Places you visit  
  - Travel patterns (e.g., transaction in Portland while living in Florida)

### 3. **Observed Data**
Information collected automatically from your devices.
- Example: phone location services tracking your movements.
- Shared with carriers and other systems.

## Key Message
>[!Warning]
>Be cautious when clicking **share** or **store** — know where your data is going and how it may be used or collected.

___
## What Is a Bit?
- A **bit** (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data in computing.
- It can have only **two values: 0 or 1**.
- Computers interpret everything — text, images, audio — as patterns of bits.

## How Bits Are Stored or Transmitted
Bits are represented physically using **two discrete states**, such as:
- On / Off (like a light switch)  
- High / Low voltage  
- Magnetized / Demagnetized  
- Light intensity levels  

## Input and Output Devices
- **Input devices** (keyboard, mouse, voice input) convert human actions into binary for the CPU.
- **Output devices** (monitors, printers, speakers) convert binary back into human-readable or human-perceivable form.

## Binary Codes for Characters
Computers use binary codes to interpret letters, numbers, and symbols.

### ASCII Example (8 bits per character):
- **A** → `01000001`  
- **9** → `00111001`  
- **#** → `00100011`

A group of **8 bits = 1 byte**.

## Digital Representation
Binary codes can represent nearly any digital information:
- Text  
- Images and graphics  
- Audio and voice  
- Video  
- Music  
___
## How Data Travels
After data is converted into bits, it must be transformed into **signals** that can move across a **medium** (copper wire, fiber-optic cable, or wireless airwaves).  
Signals carry digital bits as:
- Electrical pulses  
- Light pulses  
- Radio/air waves  

A signal may change forms multiple times as it passes through different media from source to destination.

## Three Main Transmission Methods

### 1. Electrical Signals
- Data is transmitted as **electrical pulses**.  
- Uses **copper cables** (e.g., Ethernet cables).  

### 2. Optical Signals
- Electrical data is converted into **light pulses**.  
- Uses **fiber-optic cables**, ideal for **long-distance** and **high-speed** communication.

### 3. Wireless Signals
- Uses **infrared**, **microwave**, or **radio waves** through the air.  
- Forms the basis of **Wi-Fi**, mobile networks, and other wireless systems.

## Where These Are Used
- **Homes & small businesses:** typically use copper cables or Wi-Fi.  
- **Large networks & ISPs:** use fiber-optic cables for faster and more reliable long-distance transmission.

___
## What Is Throughput?
- **Throughput** is the amount of data sent and received over a connection.
- It includes any delays in both directions, impacting the overall data flow.
- **Bandwidth** is the capacity of medium to carry data.

## Measuring Throughput with Speedtest.net
- **Download speed**: The rate at which data is received, measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
- **Upload speed**: The rate at which data is sent, also measured in Mbps.

### Example:
- Download speed: 77.86 Mbps  
- Upload speed: 23.70 Mbps

## Key Observations
- Typically, download speeds are higher than upload speeds in home networks.
- Speed tests help measure network performance and the efficiency of your internet connection.

>[!Notes] 
>- You can also visit this site [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/)
>- These tools are valuable for assessing both local network and ISP performance.
## Why Download Speed Is Higher Than Upload Speed

- Most home internet connections are **asymmetric**.
- ISPs give **more bandwidth for download** because users stream, browse, and download more than they upload.
- Technologies like DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and Cable allocate **more frequency channels** to download and fewer to upload.
- Upload traffic causes more **network congestion**, so ISPs intentionally limit it.
- **Speedtest** site simply measures what your ISP provides; it does not create the difference.

**Result:**  
High download speed + low upload speed is normal for home internet connections.
