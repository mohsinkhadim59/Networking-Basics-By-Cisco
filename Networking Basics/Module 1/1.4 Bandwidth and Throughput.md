## What Is Throughput?
- **Throughput** is the amount of data sent and received over a connection.
- It includes any delays in both directions, impacting the overall data flow.
- **Bandwidth** is the capacity of medium to carry data.

## Measuring Throughput with Speedtest.net
- **Download speed**: The rate at which data is received, measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
- **Upload speed**: The rate at which data is sent, also measured in Mbps.

### Example:
- Download speed: 77.86 Mbps  
- Upload speed: 23.70 Mbps

## Key Observations
- Typically, download speeds are higher than upload speeds in home networks.
- Speed tests help measure network performance and the efficiency of your internet connection.

>[!Notes] 
>- You can also visit this site [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net/)
>- These tools are valuable for assessing both local network and ISP performance.
## Why Download Speed Is Higher Than Upload Speed

- Most home internet connections are **asymmetric**.
- ISPs give **more bandwidth for download** because users stream, browse, and download more than they upload.
- Technologies like DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) and Cable allocate **more frequency channels** to download and fewer to upload.
- Upload traffic causes more **network congestion**, so ISPs intentionally limit it.
- **Speedtest** site simply measures what your ISP provides; it does not create the difference.

**Result:**  
High download speed + low upload speed is normal for home internet connections.
