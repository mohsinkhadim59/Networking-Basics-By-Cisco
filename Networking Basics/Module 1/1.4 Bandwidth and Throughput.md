## What Is Throughput?
- **Throughput** is the amount of data sent and received over a connection.
- It includes any delays in both directions, impacting the overall data flow.

## Measuring Throughput with Speedtest.net
- **Download speed**: The rate at which data is received, measured in megabits per second (Mbps).
- **Upload speed**: The rate at which data is sent, also measured in Mbps.

### Example:
- Download speed: 77.86 Mbps  
- Upload speed: 23.70 Mbps

## Key Observations
- Typically, download speeds are higher than upload speeds in home networks.
- Speed tests help measure network performance and the efficiency of your internet connection.

## Additional Notes
- Other websites also provide similar speed tests.
- These tools are valuable for assessing both local network and ISP performance.
