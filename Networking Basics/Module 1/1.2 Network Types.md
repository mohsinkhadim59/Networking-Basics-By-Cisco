- **Who Owns “The Internet”?**
	- The internet is not owned by any individual or group. The internet is a worldwide collection of interconnected networks (internetwork or internet for short), cooperating with each other to exchange information using common standards. Through telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links, internet users can exchange information in a variety of forms

- **Local Networks**
	- Local Networks comes in all sizes such as:
		- From consisting of two computers to networks connecting hundreds or thousands of devices just like SOHO (Small office/home office) which lets us share our resources like printers, music, internet etc.
		- In business there are large networks such as using some purchasing platform where millions or billions of buyers are coming to buy. It  can be considered as **Network of Networks** where thousand of local networks are connected to each other in literal sense.
	 -  Communication over network is efficient and less expensive than phone calls and it also allows us to rapidly communicate.

>[!Tip]
>One must have basic understanding of all the internet devices that are around us related to different fields like sensors in agricultures, automobiles GPS and other sensors, even our smart watches or mobile phones. I hope we are not forgetting about the smart appliances that are used in our homes.
