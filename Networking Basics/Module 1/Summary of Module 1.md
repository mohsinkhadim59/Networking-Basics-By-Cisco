## 1.2: The Internet as a Network of Networks
- The Internet is not owned by any single individual or group.
- It is a global network of interconnected networks that cooperate using common standards.
- Data travels through various media like telephone wires, fiber-optic cables, wireless transmissions, and satellite links.

## Small and Large Networks
- **SOHO networks**: Small home networks connecting a few computers and the Internet, allowing remote access to corporate resources.
- **Medium to large networks**: Used by corporations and schools, connecting hundreds or thousands of devices across multiple locations.
- The Internet itself connects hundreds of millions of computers globally.

## Internet-Connected Devices
- Beyond computers, many devices are connected to the Internet: smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, smart home appliances, and even medical devices like pacemakers.

## 1.3: Categories of Personal Data
- **Volunteered data**: Data explicitly shared by users, such as social media profiles, photos, and videos.
- **Observed data**: Data collected from user actions, like location information from cell phones.
- **Inferred data**: Data derived from analysis of volunteered or observed data, such as credit scores.

## Data Transmission and Signals
- **Bit**: The smallest unit of data, representing either a 0 or a 1.
- **Transmission methods**: Electrical signals (via copper wires), optical signals (via fiber optics), and wireless signals (via radio waves).

## Bandwidth vs. Throughput
- **Bandwidth**: The capacity of a medium to carry data, typically measured in bits per second (bps), kbps, mbps, or gbps.
- **Throughput**: The actual rate of data transfer, which may be lower than the bandwidth due to factors like latency and network congestion.

## Latency
- **Latency**: The delay in data traveling from one point to another, influenced by the number of network devices in the path.
