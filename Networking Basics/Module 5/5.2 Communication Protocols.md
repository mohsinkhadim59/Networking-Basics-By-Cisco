# Communication Protocols

Communication happens everywhere — chatting with friends, emailing teachers, video-calling family, or interviewing for a job.  
Each situation has its **own expectations, rules, and style**, even if we don’t always think about them consciously.

Before any two people can exchange information successfully, they must agree (explicitly or implicitly) on **how** they will communicate. This agreement forms a *protocol* — just like in networking.

## Agreements Before Communication  
When humans communicate, we first establish certain rules:

- **What method will we use?**  
  (Face-to-face, phone call, text message, email, etc.)

- **Which language will we use?**  
  (English? Hindi? Japanese?)

- **Acknowledgement or confirmation?**
   (Yes i did understand it or roger that.)

These choices allow both sides to understand and participate in the exchange.

##  Human Communication Protocols  
Just like computer networks, effective real-world communication follows basic rules/protocols:

-  Identified sender and receiver  
  You must know *who* is talking and *who* is receiving the message.

-  Agreed-upon communication channel  
  (Voice, video, written text, images, etc.)

-  Common language and grammar
  Without shared meaning, communication breaks down.

-  Speed and timing expectations 
  Example:  
  - texting → quick replies expected  
  - email → slower, more formal replies accepted

- Acknowledgment or confirmation  
  (“Got it”, “Okay”, read receipts, head nods, thumbs-up reactions)

These human communication requirements directly parallel what computer networks must also manage.

##  How This Relates to Network Protocols

When devices communicate on a network, they also need:

- **A sender and receiver** (source & destination address)  
- **A communication medium** (copper, fiber, Wi-Fi)  
- **A shared language** (protocols like TCP/IP)  
- **Rules for timing** (order, speed, delays)  
- **Acknowledgment systems** (ACKs, retransmissions)

Without these, data cannot arrive correctly — just like a conversation cannot succeed without shared rules.
