Communication happens everywhere like chatting with friends, emailing teachers, video-calling family, or interviewing for a job.  
Each situation has its **own expectations, rules, and style**, even if we don’t always think about them consciously.

Before any two people can exchange information successfully, they must agree (explicitly or implicitly) on **how** they will communicate. This agreement forms a *protocol* — just like in networking.

## Agreements Before Communication  
When humans communicate, we first establish certain rules:

- **What method will we use?**  
  (Face-to-face, phone call, text message, email, etc.)
![Method](/Imagesn/42.png)
- **Which language will we use?**  
  (English? Hindi? Japanese?)
-![Method](/Imagesn/43.png)
- **Acknowledgement or confirmation?**
   (Yes i did understand it or roger that.)
   ![Method](/Imagesn/44.png)
These choices allow both sides to understand and participate in the exchange.

##  Human Communication Protocols  
Just like computer networks, effective real-world communication follows basic rules/protocols:

-  Identified sender and receiver  
  You must know *who* is talking and *who* is receiving the message.

-  Agreed-upon communication channel  
  (Voice, video, written text, images, etc.)

-  Common language and grammar
  Without shared meaning, communication breaks down.

-  Speed and timing expectations 
  Example:  
  - texting → quick replies expected  
  - email → slower, more formal replies accepted

- Acknowledgment or confirmation  
  (“Got it”, “Okay”, read receipts, head nods, thumbs-up reactions)

These human communication requirements directly parallel what computer networks must also manage.

##  How This Relates to Network Protocols

When devices communicate on a network, they also need:

- **A sender and receiver** (source & destination address)  
- **A communication medium** (copper, fiber, Wi-Fi)  
- **A shared language** (protocols like TCP/IP)  
- **Rules for timing** (order, speed, delays)  
- **Acknowledgment systems** (ACKs, retransmissions)

Without these, data cannot arrive correctly , just like a conversation cannot succeed without shared rules.

---

### Why Protocols Matter

Just like humans, computers use rules or **protocols** to communicate. These protocols ensure that devices can successfully send, receive, interpret, and acknowledge data.

Networking protocols define many aspects of communication over a local network, including **message format, message size, timing, encoding, encapsulation, and message patterns**.

### **Protocol Characteristics**

| **Protocol Characteristic** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Message format**          | When a message is sent, it must use a specific structure. Formats depend on the type of message and the channel used to deliver it.                                                                        |
| **Message size**            | Strict rules define the size of data pieces sent across the network. Long messages may need to be broken into smaller segments to ensure reliable delivery.                                                |
| **Timing**                  | Communication often depends on timing how fast bits are sent and how long a device may transmit within one session.                                                                                        |
| **Encoding**                | Before sending data, the message is converted into bits and then encoded as electrical impulses, light waves, or radio signals depending on the medium. The receiver decodes these signals back into data. |
| **Encapsulation**           | Each transmitted message includes a header with addressing information so the network knows where to send it. Encapsulation adds this information and ensures the message reaches the right destination.   |
| **Message pattern**         | Some exchanges require acknowledgments before the next message can be sent. Request/response patterns are common, but some messages are simply streamed without waiting for responses.                     |

## How Devices See and Communicate on a Network

The visual layout of a network:
![Visual Layout](/Imagesn/45.png)
- **End devices:** desktops, laptops, servers
    
- **Intermediary devices:** switches, routers
    
-  MAC addresses, IP addresses, default gateways, DNS server info, interface details, etc.
    

While humans see the full network through diagrams, **devices do not**.  
Each device only knows its **own addressing information**, like:
![Device bubble](/Imagesn/46.png)
- Its IP address
    
- The network it belongs to
    
- Its default gateway
    
- DNS server address
    

Devices do _not_ see the whole network. They rely on **protocols** to understand how to send and receive information.

## Key Questions Devices Must Answer

Protocols help a device determine:

- What is _my_ IP address?
    
- Which network am I part of?
    
- Is the destination on my network or another network?
    
- If the destination is remote, where do I send the packet next?
    
- How do I know if my data was received, or if it must be resent?

## Protocols That Make Communication Possible

Network communications are broken into **packets**. Many protocols work together, each handling different tasks:

### **1. Physical and Link Layer Protocols**
![Protocols](/Imagesn/49.png)
- **Ethernet** and **Wireless LAN protocols**  
    Connect devices physically or wirelessly to the network.
    

### **2. Addressing and Configuration**

- **DHCP** and **ICMPv6**  
    Provide:
    
    - IP address
        
    - Subnet/network info
        
    - Default gateway (where to send packets destined for other networks)
        
    - DNS server address
        

### **3. Name Resolution**

- **DNS**  
    When you enter a domain (e.g., `www.example.com`), DNS provides the **IP address** so the device can reach the correct server.
    

### **4. Delivery Across Networks**

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**  
    Moves packets from the **source** to the **destination**, even across multiple networks and routers.
    

### **5. Reliability**

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
    Ensures all data is delivered correctly.  
    If some packets are lost, **TCP resends them**.

 >[!example] Requesting a Web Page
>
>1. User requests `www.example.com`.
  >  
>2. Device asks **DNS** for the web server’s IP address.
  >  
>3. **IP** delivers packets to the destination server.
  >  
>4. **TCP** ensures the full webpage data arrives without errors.
  >  
>5. The server sends back the requested page.

## Final Idea

Although we see networks as big connected maps, devices themselves operate using **rules (protocols)** that tell them:

- where they are,
    
- how to communicate, and
    
- how to reach others.
    
![Protocols](/Imagesn/50.png)
It’s the cooperation of many protocols that lets a device “understand” the network and successfully exchange information.

## The Internet and Standards

As more and more devices and technologies come online, it might seem impossible to keep everything working together smoothly. Yet services like email continue to function reliably across millions of devices. The reason behind this consistency is the use of internet standards.

>[!note] A standard is simply a rule that defines how something should be done. In networking, standards ensure that devices made by different companies all follow the same protocols in the same way. Because of this shared foundation, information can move between completely different types of devices without any trouble.

>[!example]
>Take email as an example. The way an email is created, sent, forwarded, and displayed follows a set of agreed-upon standards. So if someone sends an email from a laptop, another person can easily read it on a phone, as long as both devices follow the same email standards. These shared rules make the entire internet interoperable, predictable, and functional.

## Network Standards Organizations

- Internet standards are developed through collaboration, testing, and discussion among multiple organizations.  
- New standards go through a formal development process documented in **Request for Comments (RFCs)**, which record the evolution and reasoning behind standards.  
- The **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)** publishes and manages RFCs, ensuring that widely accepted standards are officially recorded and accessible for implementation.
