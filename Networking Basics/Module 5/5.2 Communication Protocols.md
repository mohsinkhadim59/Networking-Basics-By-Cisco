Communication happens everywhere like chatting with friends, emailing teachers, video-calling family, or interviewing for a job.  
Each situation has its **own expectations, rules, and style**, even if we don’t always think about them consciously.

Before any two people can exchange information successfully, they must agree (explicitly or implicitly) on **how** they will communicate. This agreement forms a *protocol* — just like in networking.

## Agreements Before Communication  
When humans communicate, we first establish certain rules:

- **What method will we use?**  
  (Face-to-face, phone call, text message, email, etc.)

- **Which language will we use?**  
  (English? Hindi? Japanese?)

- **Acknowledgement or confirmation?**
   (Yes i did understand it or roger that.)

These choices allow both sides to understand and participate in the exchange.

##  Human Communication Protocols  
Just like computer networks, effective real-world communication follows basic rules/protocols:

-  Identified sender and receiver  
  You must know *who* is talking and *who* is receiving the message.

-  Agreed-upon communication channel  
  (Voice, video, written text, images, etc.)

-  Common language and grammar
  Without shared meaning, communication breaks down.

-  Speed and timing expectations 
  Example:  
  - texting → quick replies expected  
  - email → slower, more formal replies accepted

- Acknowledgment or confirmation  
  (“Got it”, “Okay”, read receipts, head nods, thumbs-up reactions)

These human communication requirements directly parallel what computer networks must also manage.

##  How This Relates to Network Protocols

When devices communicate on a network, they also need:

- **A sender and receiver** (source & destination address)  
- **A communication medium** (copper, fiber, Wi-Fi)  
- **A shared language** (protocols like TCP/IP)  
- **Rules for timing** (order, speed, delays)  
- **Acknowledgment systems** (ACKs, retransmissions)

Without these, data cannot arrive correctly , just like a conversation cannot succeed without shared rules.

 ## Why Protocols Matter

Just like humans, computers use rules—or **protocols**—to communicate. These protocols ensure that devices can successfully send, receive, interpret, and acknowledge data.

Networking protocols define many aspects of communication over a local network, including **message format, message size, timing, encoding, encapsulation, and message patterns**.

### **Protocol Characteristics**

| **Protocol Characteristic** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------|-----------------|
| **Message format** | When a message is sent, it must use a specific structure. Formats depend on the type of message and the channel used to deliver it. |
| **Message size** | Strict rules define the size of data pieces sent across the network. Long messages may need to be broken into smaller segments to ensure reliable delivery. |
| **Timing** | Communication often depends on timing—how fast bits are sent and how long a device may transmit within one session. |
| **Encoding** | Before sending data, the message is converted into bits and then encoded as electrical impulses, light waves, or radio signals depending on the medium. The receiver decodes these signals back into data. |
| **Encapsulation** | Each transmitted message includes a header with addressing information so the network knows where to send it. Encapsulation adds this information and ensures the message reaches the right destination. |
| **Message pattern** | Some exchanges require acknowledgments before the next message can be sent. Request/response patterns are common, but some messages are simply streamed without waiting for responses. |
