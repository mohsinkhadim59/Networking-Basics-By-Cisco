# Network Infrastructure Symbols

## 1. Intermediate Devices
These symbols represent devices that connect, manage, and forward data across the network.

Examples include:
- **Router**
- **Wireless Router**
- **Wireless Access Point**

![Intermediate Devices](/Imagesn/16.png)
<p align="center"><em>Figure 1: Intermediate Devices</em></p>
These are commonly seen in home and business networks to direct traffic and provide connectivity.

---

## 2. End Devices
These symbols represent devices that users interact with directly.

Examples include:
- **Laptop**
- **Printer**
- **Smartphone**
- **IP Phone**

![End Devices](/Imagesn/17.png)
<p align="center"><em>Figure 2:End Devices</em></p>
End devices send and receive data but do not forward traffic for other devices.

## 3. Network Media Symbols
These symbols represent the medium through which data travels.

Types include:
- **LAN Media**  
  - Used in local area networks  
  - Most commonly Ethernet cabling

- **WAN Media**  
  - Used for long-distance connections  
  - Commonly used by Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

- **Wireless Media**  
  - Represents Wi-Fi or other wireless communication

- **Cloud Symbol**  
  - Represents another network or the Internet

These symbols will appear throughout to visually represent how networks are structured and how devices connect.

# Summary
Network communication can travel through a simple point-to-point cable or a complex global network. The **network infrastructure** serves as the platform that enables stable and reliable communication between devices.

The infrastructure is built from three main categories of hardware components:

1. **End Devices**
2. **Intermediate Devices**
3. **Network Media**

These devices and media make up the physical (hardware) portion of a network. Hardware components are usually visible such as laptops, PCs, cabling, switches, routers, and wireless access points but some, like wireless signals, are invisible.

## End Devices (Hosts)
End devices are the network components users interact with directly. They act as the interface between people and the communication network.

>[!Examples] 
>- Computers (workstations, laptops, file servers, web servers)
>- Network printers
>- Telephones and teleconferencing equipment
>- Security cameras
>- Mobile devices (smartphones, tablets, PDAs)
>- Wireless debit/credit card readers and barcode scanners
>
These devices send and receive data, forming the endpoints of network communication.
