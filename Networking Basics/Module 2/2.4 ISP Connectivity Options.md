## ISP Services and Internet Connectivity

An **Internet Service Provider (ISP)** is the organization that connects a home or business network to the internet. ISPs may include cable companies, landline telephone providers, cellular carriers, or independent providers that lease bandwidth from other companies.

## Services Offered by ISPs
Many ISPs provide additional services to their subscribers, such as:
- Email accounts
- Cloud or network storage
- Website hosting
- Automated backup services
- Security services

These value-added offerings support users beyond basic internet access.

## Role of ISPs in the Global Internet
ISPs form a worldwide system of interconnected networks. They connect to each other in a hierarchical structure to ensure that data typically travels the shortest possible path between a source and destination.

## The Internet Backbone
The **internet backbone** is the high-speed, long-distance network that interconnects major ISP networks around the world.  
Key characteristics:
- Built primarily using **fiber-optic cables**
- Runs underground across continents
- Extends under the sea through submarine fiber cables to connect countries and continents

This backbone functions like an “information superhighway,” enabling global, high-speed communication.

#  ISP Connections

The global internet backbone is built from a vast network of fiber-optic cables, routers, and switches operated by ISPs. While the external infrastructure is complex, connecting a home network to an ISP is usually simple for the average user.

## Basic ISP Connection
The simplest method is:
- A **modem connected directly to a computer**, providing a direct link to the ISP.

>[!Warning]
>This method is **not recommended** because the computer is exposed to the internet without security or network protection.

## Secure and Common ISP Connection
Most home and small business networks use:
- A **wireless integrated router** connected to the modem.

This router provides:
- **Secure connectivity** to the ISP  
- An internal **switch** for wired devices  
- A **wireless access point (AP)** for Wi-Fi devices  
- **Automatic IP addressing** for internal hosts  
- Basic **security features** (e.g., NAT, firewall)

This setup keeps internal devices protected and allows multiple hosts to connect simultaneously.
