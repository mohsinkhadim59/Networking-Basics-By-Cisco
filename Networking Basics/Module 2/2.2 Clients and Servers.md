# Client and Server Roles in a Network

## Hosts in a Network
- Any device that participates directly in network communication is called a **host**.
- Hosts can **send** and **receive** messages.
- In modern networks, a computer can function as a:
  - **Client**
  - **Server**
  - **Both**
- The role depends entirely on the **software installed** on the device.

## Server Roles
- A **server** runs specialized software that provides information or services to other hosts.
- Each network service requires **dedicated server software**.
- Examples:
  - Web servers (deliver webpages)
  - Email servers (store and distribute email)
  - File servers (store and manage shared files)

## Client Roles
- A **client** uses software that requests data or services from a server.
- Examples of client software:
  - Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
  - Email clients (Outlook)
  - File explorers (Windows File Explorer)

## How Clients and Servers Interact
- A client requests a resource (e.g., a webpage).
- The server responds with the requested information.
- Example:
  - A browser requests a webpage → the web server returns it.
  - An email client sends/receives messages through the email server.

## Server Types and Descriptions

| Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Email** | The email server runs email server software. Clients use mail client software, such as Microsoft Outlook, to access email on the server.                     |
| **Web**   | The web server runs web server software. Clients use browser software, such as Windows Internet Explorer, to access web pages on the server.                 |
| **File**  | The file server stores corporate and user files in a central location. Client devices access these files with client software such as Windows File Explorer. |

# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

## What Is a P2P Network?
- In many small businesses and homes, a computer can act as **both a client and a server**.
- When multiple computers share resources directly without dedicated servers, the network is called a **peer-to-peer (P2P) network**.

## How P2P Works
- The simplest P2P network: **two computers** connected directly (wired or wireless), each able to share data and services.
- Larger P2P networks can be created by connecting multiple PCs using a **network device** like a switch.

## Limitations
- A host acting as *both* client and server may experience **performance slowdowns**.
- P2P becomes inefficient in environments with heavy traffic or many users.
- Large businesses typically require **dedicated servers** for reliability and scale.

<p align="center"><em>Figure 2: P2P Networks</em></p>

## Advantages of P2P Networks
- **Easy to set up**
- **Less complex**
- **Low cost** (no need for dedicated servers or expensive hardware)
- Ideal for **simple tasks**, such as:
  - File sharing  
  - Printer sharing

## Disadvantages of P2P Networks
- **No centralized administration**
- **Weaker security**
- **Not scalable**
- All devices may act as both clients and servers, causing **reduced performance**
___
# Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Applications

## How P2P Applications Work
- A **P2P application** allows a device to act as **both a client and a server at the same time**.
- In this model:
  - **Every client is also a server**
  - **Every server is also a client**
- Each participating device must:
  - Provide a **user interface**
  - Run a **background service** to support sharing

## Communication in P2P Applications
- Both devices can **simultaneously send and receive** data.
- Resources (files, data, messages) are exchanged directly between peers.

## Hybrid P2P Systems
- Resource sharing is **decentralized**.
- However, the **index** (the location of shared resources) is **stored centrally**.
- A peer contacts the **index server** to find where a resource is stored, then connects directly to the peer that has it.

## Summary

- P2P applications support flexible sharing.
- Hybrid P2P systems combine decentralized sharing with centralized indexing for faster resource discovery.

# Multiple Roles in the Network

## Servers Handling Multiple Clients
- A computer running **server software** can provide services to **one or many clients simultaneously**.
- Server capacity depends on hardware performance and network load.

## One Computer, Multiple Server Roles
- A single machine can run **multiple types of server software** at the same time.
- Common in homes or small businesses where one device may function as:
  - **File Server**
  - **Web Server**
  - **Email Server**

## One Computer, Multiple Client Roles
- A device can also run **multiple client applications** at once.
- Each service requires its own client software.
- With multiple client applications installed, a host can connect to **multiple servers simultaneously**.

>[!Example]
A user may:
>- Check **email**
>- Browse **web pages**
>- Use **instant messaging**
>- Listen to **internet radio**  
—all at the same time, using different client software.
