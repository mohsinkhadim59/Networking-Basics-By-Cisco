# Mobile Devices and Wi-Fi

## Freedom and Mobility
Mobile devices allow people to work, study, communicate, and access information from almost anywhere. They no longer need to be connected to a physical network. Locations such as:
- Internet cafés  
- College campuses  
- Public hotspots  
enable wireless access for learning, browsing, and communication.

Modern mobile devices are powerful enough to perform tasks that once required wired desktop computers.

## Wi-Fi Connectivity
Most mobile devices can connect to Wi-Fi networks. Using Wi-Fi is recommended because:
- **It does not count against your cellular data plan**
- **It consumes less battery power** than cellular radios

> [!tip] Always prefer Wi-Fi over mobile data when available to save both data usage and battery life.

## Wi-Fi Security Precautions
To protect wireless communication on mobile devices:
- Never send login or password information in **unencrypted text**
- Use a **VPN** when sending sensitive data
- Enable **security on home networks**
- Use **WPA2 or higher encryption** for better protection

> [!Warning] Avoid connecting to Wi-Fi networks that do not use WPA2 or higher encryption, as your data can be easily intercepted.

# Configure Mobile Wi-Fi Connectivity

If a mobile device does not automatically prompt to join a Wi-Fi network, the network’s **SSID** broadcast may be turned off or the device may not be set to connect automatically. In these cases, manual configuration is required.

**SSID (Service Set Identifier)** is the name assigned to a wireless network.  
The **passphrase** is the “wireless password” required to join the network.

Both **SSID** and **passphrase** must be typed **exactly** as they appear in the router’s configuration. Any spelling, spacing, or capitalization error will prevent the device from connecting.

## Manually Connect to Wi-Fi on Android
1. Go to **Settings > Add network**  
2. Enter the **SSID**  
3. Select **Security** type  
4. Enter the **Password**  
5. Tap **Save**

> Note: Android interfaces vary by version and manufacturer. Menu names may differ.

## Manually Connect to Wi-Fi on iOS
1. Go to **Settings > Wi-Fi > Other**  
2. Enter the **SSID**  
3. Select **Security** type  
4. Tap **Other Network**  
5. Enter the **Password**  
6. Tap **Join**

> [!note]
> Mobile devices automatically prefer **Wi-Fi** for internet access when a network is available and the device can connect and receive an IP address.  
> If no Wi-Fi network is found, the device switches to its **cellular data** connection (if configured).  
>
> These transitions usually happen seamlessly. For example, when moving from a **4G** area to **3G**, the 4G radio turns off and the 3G radio turns on without interrupting the connection.

# Bluetooth Pairing

Bluetooth pairing occurs when two Bluetooth-enabled devices establish a connection to share resources. For pairing to begin, both devices must have their Bluetooth radios turned on. One device starts searching, and the other device must be placed in **discoverable mode** (also called *visible mode*) so it can be detected.

When a device is discoverable, it shares the following information:

- **Name**
- **Bluetooth class**
- **Available services**
- **Technical details** (supported features and Bluetooth specifications)

## Authentication (PIN)
During the pairing process, a **PIN (Personal Identification Number)** may be required.  
- The PIN can be a number, code, or passkey.  
- Once entered, it is stored so future connections can happen automatically.  
- This makes accessories like Bluetooth headsets auto-connect when powered on and within range.

> [!note]
> Discoverable mode is temporary on most devices for security reasons. Always disable it after pairing to prevent unauthorized connection attempts.
