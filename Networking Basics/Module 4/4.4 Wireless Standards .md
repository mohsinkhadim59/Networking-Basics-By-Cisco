# Wi-Fi Networks

A number of standards have been developed to ensure that wireless devices can communicate. They specify the RF spectrum used, data rates, how the information is transmitted, and more.  

The main organization responsible for creating wireless technical standards is the **Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)**.

## IEEE 802.11 Standard
The **IEEE 802.11 standard** governs the WLAN environment. There are amendments to the 802.11 standard that describe characteristics for different standards of wireless communications.  

- Wireless standards for LANs use the **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** frequency bands.  
- Collectively, these technologies are referred to as **Wi-Fi**.

## Wi-Fi Alliance
Another organization, the **Wi-Fi Alliance**, is responsible for testing wireless LAN devices from different manufacturers.  

- The **Wi-Fi logo** on a device indicates that the equipment meets standards and should operate with other devices using the same standard.

# Wireless Router Settings (802.11 Standards)

- Wireless routers that follow the **802.11 standards** come with several settings that control how the WLAN operates. Configuring these correctly ensures devices can communicate efficiently and securely.

- **Network Mode** determines which wireless technologies the router supports. Common options include **802.11b**, **802.11g**, **802.11n**, or **Mixed Mode**, which allows multiple standards to coexist.

- The **SSID** (Service Set Identifier) is the name of your WLAN. All devices that want to connect must use the same SSID. You can also choose whether to **broadcast the SSID**. By default, SSID Broadcast is **enabled**, making the network visible to nearby devices.

- The **Standard Channel** defines the specific frequency channel used for communication. Most routers set this to **Auto**, allowing the access point (AP) to select the optimum channel automatically. This helps reduce interference from other wireless networks.

> **Tip:** Understanding and configuring these settings properly can improve Wi-Fi performance, reduce interference, and increase network security.

# Network Mode and SSID

- The **802.11 protocol** allows wireless networks to achieve higher throughput depending on the environment. If all devices connect using the same 802.11 standard, maximum speeds for that standard can be achieved. However, if the access point is set to accept only one standard, devices that do not support it will not be able to connect.

- A **mixed mode** network allows devices using any of the existing Wi-Fi standards to connect. This provides flexibility for older devices while still supporting newer standards.

## SSID (Service Set Identifier)

- The **SSID** is a case-sensitive alphanumeric string, up to 32 characters long, used to identify a specific wireless network. It is included in the header of all frames transmitted over the WLAN.  

- Wireless devices, known as **stations (STAs)**, use the SSID to determine which WLAN they belong to and which devices they can communicate with. Essentially, the SSID is the **name of the network**.

- Most routers **broadcast the SSID by default**, allowing devices to automatically discover the network. If SSID broadcast is disabled, devices must **manually enter** the network name to connect.

> [!Important]
>  Disabling SSID broadcast can make it slightly harder for legitimate clients to find your network, but it **does not prevent unauthorized access**. Always use the **strongest available encryption** to secure your wireless network.
