# Home Network Equipment

A typical home network contains **two networks**:

- **Public network** – provided by the ISP (Internet Service Provider), usually cable or DSL.
- **Private home network** – the internal network used by devices in the home.

Because ISP networks use different transmission methods and protocols than Ethernet, a device is required to convert the incoming signal.

## Modem
A **modem** converts signals from the service provider into a format usable by the home network.

- Cable modems use a **coaxial cable input** from the cable provider.
- They provide an **output port** (Ethernet) that connects to the home network.
- Some devices combine a modem with a wireless router into a single unit.

## Combined Modem/Router Units
Many home network devices have:

- A connector for the cable/DSL line  
- LAN (Local Area Network) Ethernet ports  
- Built-in wireless access points  

These devices eliminate the need for a separate modem.

## Home Wireless Routers
Home networking devices are often called **wireless routers**. They include:

- **An Internet (WAN) port** – often color-coded (commonly yellow)  
- **LAN ports** – typically switched Ethernet ports  
- **A built-in wireless access point**  

### Network Separation
Wireless routers separate the network into two sides:

1. **WAN (Internet) side** – from the modem/provider  
2. **LAN (Local Network) side** – wired and wireless home devices  

### Local Network (LAN)
The LAN can include:

- **Wired devices** (connected via Ethernet cables)  
- **Wireless devices** (connected through Wi-Fi)  

Both wired and wireless devices usually receive IP addresses from the same network.

> [!note]
> On most home networks, **Wi-Fi and Ethernet devices share the same IP address range**, since both connect to the same LAN managed by the router.

# Typical Home Network Routers

Small business and home routers typically include two primary types of ports:

## Ethernet (LAN) Ports
These ports connect to the internal switch portion of the router.  
They are usually labeled **“Ethernet”** or **“LAN.”**

- Devices connected to these ports are all on the **same local network (LAN)**.
- Wired devices such as PCs, printers, and smart TVs commonly use these ports.

## Internet (WAN) Port
This port connects the router to the **internet side**—typically by connecting to a modem.

- The port is often labeled **“Internet”** or **“WAN.”**
- This port is on a **different network** than the LAN ports.
- It separates the public network from the private home network.

## Built-in Wireless Access Point
Most home routers also include:

- A radio antenna  
- A built-in **wireless access point (WAP)**  

By default:

- **Wireless devices share the same LAN** as the wired Ethernet devices.
- The **Internet (WAN) port** is the only port that belongs to a **different network** in the default configuration.

> [!note]
> Whether a device connects via Wi-Fi or Ethernet, it usually receives an IP address from the same local LAN network.
