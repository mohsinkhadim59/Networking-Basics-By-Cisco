# LAN Wireless Frequencies

Home wireless networks mainly rely on two unlicensed frequency ranges: **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz**. Both bands are open for public use, which is why so many everyday devices can operate on them without requiring any kind of radio license.

### Bluetooth and the 2.4 GHz Band
Bluetooth lives entirely in the **2.4 GHz** range.  
It’s not designed for high speed or long distance, but it does have a useful trick: it can talk to **multiple devices at once**.  
Because of this, it has become a standard way to connect things like:

- wireless keyboards and mice  
- portable speakers  
- headphones and earbuds  
- printers  
- wearables  

It sends small amounts of data with minimal power, which makes it ideal for accessories and audio.

### Wi-Fi on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
Wi-Fi, on the other hand, uses both **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** depending on the standard (802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax, etc.).

Wi-Fi radios transmit at a much **higher power** than Bluetooth.  
Because of that, Wi-Fi generally offers:

- a far **longer range**  
- **higher throughput**  
- better support for many users on the same network  

This is what makes Wi-Fi the backbone of most home networks, while Bluetooth handles short-range personal devices.

>The reason all of this technology coexists is that these specific frequency bands are set aside for **unlicensed use**. As long as devices follow the rules for power limits and interference control, anyone can use them  from home gadgets to industrial IoT.

# Wired Network Technologies

Even though wireless dominates most home networks, there are still plenty of situations where a **wired connection** is the better choice—especially for devices that need stable, consistent bandwidth without interference from neighbors or other wireless traffic.

---

## Ethernet in the Home
The workhorse of wired networking is **Ethernet**. It’s a collection of protocols that let devices communicate reliably over a local wired network. You’ll find it used for:

- desktops and laptops that need stable performance  
- gaming consoles  
- smart TVs and streaming boxes  
- network storage devices (like NAS units)

Ethernet LANs can run over a variety of physical cable types, depending on the home setup and what kind of wiring the builder installed.

### 1. UTP Patch Cables (RJ-45)
Most devices connect using **unshielded twisted pair (UTP)** patch cables.  
These are the typical cables with RJ-45 connectors you plug directly into a switch or router. They come pre-terminated in different lengths, so no special tools are needed.

Some modern homes already have **in-wall Ethernet jacks**, which makes wiring much easier. If the home doesn’t have Ethernet wiring, alternative technologies like **powerline networking** can extend wired connectivity using electrical outlets.

- **Category 5e (Cat5e)** is the most common.  
- It contains **4 twisted pairs**, which helps cut down electrical noise.

### 2. Coaxial Cable
Coax is built differently than UTP. It uses:

- a solid inner conductor  
- insulation  
- a surrounding metallic shield  
- an outer protective jacket  

This structure makes coax very good at resisting interference. It’s traditionally used for cable TV, but some home networks use it with technologies like MoCA to move Ethernet around the house.

### 3. Fiber-Optic Cable
Fiber is the fastest option by far.  
It uses strands of **glass or plastic** roughly the thickness of a human hair. Instead of electricity, fiber carries **light**, which allows:

- extremely high bandwidth  
- very long-distance transmission  
- resistance to electrical interference

Fiber is becoming more common in modern infrastructure but is still rarely installed inside older homes unless added intentionally.
