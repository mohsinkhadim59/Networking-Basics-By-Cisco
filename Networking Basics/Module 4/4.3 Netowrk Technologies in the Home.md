# LAN Wireless Frequencies

Home wireless networks mainly rely on two unlicensed frequency ranges: **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz**. Both bands are open for public use, which is why so many everyday devices can operate on them without requiring any kind of radio license.

### Bluetooth and the 2.4 GHz Band
Bluetooth lives entirely in the **2.4 GHz** range.  
It’s not designed for high speed or long distance, but it does have a useful trick: it can talk to **multiple devices at once**.  
Because of this, it has become a standard way to connect things like:

- wireless keyboards and mice  
- portable speakers  
- headphones and earbuds  
- printers  
- wearables  

It sends small amounts of data with minimal power, which makes it ideal for accessories and audio.

### Wi-Fi on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
Wi-Fi, on the other hand, uses both **2.4 GHz** and **5 GHz** depending on the standard (802.11n, 802.11ac, 802.11ax, etc.).

Wi-Fi radios transmit at a much **higher power** than Bluetooth.  
Because of that, Wi-Fi generally offers:

- a far **longer range**  
- **higher throughput**  
- better support for many users on the same network  

This is what makes Wi-Fi the backbone of most home networks, while Bluetooth handles short-range personal devices.

>The reason all of this technology coexists is that these specific frequency bands are set aside for **unlicensed use**. As long as devices follow the rules for power limits and interference control, anyone can use them  from home gadgets to industrial IoT.
