# Wireless Router Setup & Design Considerations

## First-Time Setup

Many home wireless routers include an **automatic setup utility** to configure basic settings. These utilities usually require a PC or laptop to be connected to a **wired port** on the router. If no wired device is available, it may be necessary to configure the wireless client software on a laptop or tablet first.

To connect using a wired connection:  
1. Plug an Ethernet patch cable into the network port on the computer.  
2. Plug the other end into a **LAN port** on the router (do **not** use the port labeled “Internet”).  

> The Internet port connects to the DSL or cable modem. Some home routers have a **built-in modem**; ensure it matches your internet service type:  
> - **Cable modem**: coaxial terminal for BNC connector  
> - **DSL modem**: RJ-11 telephone-type connector  

After confirming a connection (link lights on the NIC should indicate activity), the computer needs an IP address. Most routers automatically assign an IP via **DHCP**. If not, consult the router documentation and manually configure:  
- IP address  
- Subnet mask  
- Default gateway  
- DNS information

## Design Considerations

Before entering the router configuration utility (or manually via a web browser), consider how the network will be used. Poor planning can **limit functionality** or leave the network **unprotected**.  

### 1. Network Name (SSID)
- If SSID broadcasting is enabled, the network name will be visible to all devices in range.  
- Avoid including **device model or brand name**, as it can expose vulnerabilities to attackers.  
- Default SSID settings are often known publicly and may have security weaknesses.  

### 2. Device Compatibility
- Wireless devices operate on specific frequency ranges and 802.11 standards (b/g/n/ac).  
- If a device only supports **802.11b/g**, it will not connect if the router is set to **802.11n/ac only**.  
- To accommodate older devices, routers can use **legacy mode**, allowing multiple standards to coexist (802.11a/b/g/n/ac).  
- Networks with uniform device standards achieve **maximum performance**, while mixed environments prioritize compatibility.  

### 3. Adding New Devices
- Determine who can access the network based on usage.  
- Some routers allow **guest access**, which creates a separate SSID with restricted access (internet only) for visitors.  

> [!Tip] Properly planning the network name, device compatibility, and access policies ensures security, optimal performance, and flexibility for future devices.
